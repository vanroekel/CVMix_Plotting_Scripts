# CVMix Plotting Scripts

This repo contains my CVMix plotting notebooks and processing scripts.  There are a few important prerequisites

1) a c-compiler (e.g. gcc)
2) cython
3) xarray (newest dev branch 0.73)  This is important, it corrects an issue with reading MOM data
4) script path added to your python path or imported to module namespace via the os python package

These scripts are very rough and need some cleaning, but  anyone is welcome to take them, make changes and submit PRs to me.
